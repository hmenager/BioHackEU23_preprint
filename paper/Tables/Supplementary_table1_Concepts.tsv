data heterogeneity	No	-		...		Diversity in the data caused by differences between individuals, samples or single entities (eg. single-cells) analysed.	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C28359
data integration 	No	-		Operation		Process to join together data from different sources. Horizontal integration involves integrating same type of data from different experiments. Vertical integration involves integrating different types of data from the same samples.

deep learning	No	-	Machine learning	Topic		Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods incorporating feature learning or representation learning (techniques that allow a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data). Deep learning is typically based on artificial neural networks.
